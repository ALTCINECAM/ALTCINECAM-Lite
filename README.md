# ALTCINECAM LITE
**ALTCINECAM Lite Is the Software Image for the Camera Digitalization projects. Its made from the CinePi SDK using cinepi-raw and our own simple UI Built on it.**

## Flashing the software:
We recommend you to use a fast MicroSD card and at least 16Gb for space.
For flashing the image to the card we recommend using a software called Belena Etcher. All you need to do is connect your card to the PC, unzip the ALTCINECAM-Lite.zip file found in the releases and choose the unzipped image file in Belena Etcher than choose the MicroSD card connected to your PC.

Once its finished you can disconnect the card and plug it into the Pi 5 and start testing your camera.
